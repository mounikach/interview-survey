2. What is the width of a container with 100px of width and 5px of padding?
Ans:  Width of a container = 100px of width + 5px of left padding + 5px of right padding.

4. Why does the alert show "Jack" first and then undefined?
function identity() {
    var name = 'Jack';
    alert(name);
    return
    name
};
var who = identity();
alert(who)

Answer:
-When identify() function is invoked a local variable will be created with the name “jack”.
-Hence immediately it will go to the next step and alerts the name “jack”(value of name is jack).
-Next It will go to return statement. In our program return has nothing. So it does not return anything.
-In javascript, statements/functions will not be executed after return statement.
-So the value of “who” will be undefined. That’s why it will alert “undefined”.
